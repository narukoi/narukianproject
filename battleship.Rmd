Today, we set out to apply our R programming skills to a childhood board game: Battleship. Let us begin our task by creating a simplistic version of the game, catered to the notebook format of its presentation.

Given the inability of a viewer to interact with our code, we will represent the game through a single board, with ships randomly placed, and provide an algorithm for the computer to guess various positions.

Our first step will be to create a game board with no ships on it. We can do this via the code below:

```{r board}
board <- data.frame(matrix("~", nrow = 10, ncol = 10))
colnames(board) <- seq.int(1,10)
rownames(board) <- LETTERS[seq.int(1,10)]
board
```

Next, lets create a function for creating ships. In the future we might combine all 5 ships into a single function, but for now we will split them up. We begin with the first ship: the Carrier.

```{r carrier}
carrier_fun <- function(){
  #orientation determines the direction of a ship's placement
  orientation <- unlist(sample(c('horizontal','vertical'),1))
  
  
  #change_pos will be a vector of 5 numbers designating a ship's position along one axis
  #if orientation is horizontal, change_pos = columns
  #if orientation is vertical, change_pos = rows
  start_change <- unlist(sample(seq.int(1,10),1))
  change_pos <- c(seq.int(start_change,start_change + 4))
  
  
  #we will also ensure that no part of the ship goes off the board
  #if a number in change_pos is over 10, we subtract 5 from that element
  for (i in seq(1,5))  {if (change_pos[i]>10) {
    change_pos[i] <- change_pos[i] - 5
  }}
  
  
  #static_pos will be a single number denoting a ship's position along the other axis
  static_pos <- unlist(sample(seq.int(1,10),1))
  
  
  #now we will determine the final dataset for the carrier's position
  if (orientation == 'horizontal') {
    carrier_positions <- data.frame(
      column = change_pos,
      row = static_pos,
      combination = paste(LETTERS[static_pos],change_pos,sep = "")
    )}
  else {
    carrier_positions <- data.frame(
      column = static_pos,
      row = change_pos,
      combination = paste(LETTERS[change_pos],static_pos,sep = "")
    )}
  return(carrier_positions %>%
           mutate(ship = "carrier")
  )
}
carrier <- carrier_fun()
```

One of the rules that governs Battleship is that no two shapes can be adjacent. As such, we will create a 'red zone' where no other ships can exist.

```{r carrer_red_zone}
red_zone <- function(ship_df) {
  #get the ship name from the dataframe name
  ship_name <- deparse(substitute(ship_df))
  
  #create ship_inclusive grid of the redzone
  eval(parse(text = paste(
    ship_name,"_inclusive <- expand.grid(",
    "column = (min(",ship_name,"$column) - 1):(max(",ship_name,"$column) + 1),",
    "row = (min(",ship_name,"$row) - 1):(max(",ship_name,"$row) + 1))",
    sep = ""
    )))
  
  #create ship_null grid of corners to the redzone that need to be removed
  eval(parse(text = paste(
    ship_name,"_null <- expand.grid(",
    "column = c(min(",ship_name,"_inclusive$column),max(",ship_name,"_inclusive$column)),",
    "row = c(min(",ship_name,"_inclusive$row),max(",ship_name,"_inclusive$row)))",
    sep = ""
  )))
  
  #remove the null df from the inclusive df to get the correct redzone
  eval(parse(text = paste(
    ship_name,"_red <- anti_join(",
    ship_name,"_inclusive,",
    ship_name,"_null)",
    sep = ""
    )))
  
  return(
    as.data.frame(eval(parse(
      text = paste(
        ship_name,"_red <- anti_join(",ship_name,"_inclusive,",ship_name,"_null)",
        sep = "")
      )))
    )
}

carrier_red <- red_zone(carrier)
carrier_red %>% head()
```

Now that we have the Carrier positions and redzone, we can move on to the Battleship.

```{r battleship}
battleship_fun <- function(x = sample(1:1000)) {
  #create seed mechanism in case original positions occur within previous redzones
  seed <- sample(x)
  set.seed(seed)
  #orientation determines the direction of a ship's placement
  orientation <- unlist(sample(c('horizontal','vertical'),1))
  
  
  #change_pos will be a vector of 5 numbers designating a ship's position along one axis
  #if orientation is horizontal, change_pos = columns
  #if orientation is vertical, change_pos = rows
  start_change <- unlist(sample(seq.int(1,10),1))
  change_pos <- c(seq.int(start_change,start_change + 3))
  
  
  #we will also ensure that no part of the ship goes off the board
  #if a number in change_pos is over 10, we subtract 5 from that element
  for (i in seq(1,4))  {if (change_pos[i]>10) {
    change_pos[i] <- change_pos[i] - 4
  }}
  
  
  #static_pos will be a single number denoting a ship's position along the other axis
  static_pos <- unlist(sample(seq.int(1,10),1))
  
  
  #now we will determine the final dataset for the carrier's position
  if (orientation == 'horizontal') {
    battleship_positions <- data.frame(
      column = change_pos,
      row = static_pos,
      combination = paste(LETTERS[static_pos],change_pos,sep = "")
    )}
  else {
    battleship_positions <- data.frame(
      column = static_pos,
      row = change_pos,
      combination = paste(LETTERS[change_pos],static_pos,sep = "")
    )}
  
  return(battleship_positions %>%
           mutate(ship = "battleship")
  )
  
}
battleship <- battleship_fun()
```

Notice that we don't yet have a mechanism for ensuring that the battleship doesn't position itself within the carrier redzone. To do this, we will use the following statement:

```{r bs_pos}
while(any(do.call(paste,battleship[,1:2]) %in% do.call(paste,carrier_red))) {
  battleship <- battleship_fun(sample(1:1000))
}
battleship
```

Now we will create the redzone for this ship:

```{r bs_redzone}
battleship_red <- red_zone(battleship) %>% 
  rbind(carrier_red)
```

Notice that each ship's redzone will also include the redzones from previous ships. This way, we can create a single, comprehensive list of placements that a new ship cannot be.

This workflow will be the staple of our ship position generation: 

create ship df %>% while statement to check positioning %>% create redzone %>% next ship

Now let's go ahead and generate the rest of the ships. We will hide the code, but it essentially revolves around the same code as the Battleship.

```{r other_ships, echo=FALSE}
###SUBMARINE FUNCTION
sub_fun <- function(x = sample(1:1000)) {
  seed <- sample(x)
  set.seed(seed)
  #orientation determines the direction of a ship's placement
  orientation <- unlist(sample(c('horizontal','vertical'),1))
  
  
  #change_pos will be a vector of 5 numbers designating a ship's position along one axis
  #if orientation is horizontal, change_pos = columns
  #if orientation is vertical, change_pos = rows
  start_change <- unlist(sample(seq.int(1,10),1))
  change_pos <- c(seq.int(start_change,start_change + 2))
  
  
  #we will also ensure that no part of the ship goes off the board
  #if a number in change_pos is over 10, we subtract 5 from that element
  for (i in seq(1,3))  {if (change_pos[i]>10) {
    change_pos[i] <- change_pos[i] - 3
  }}
  
  
  #static_pos will be a single number denoting a ship's position along the other axis
  static_pos <- unlist(sample(seq.int(1,10),1))
  
  
  #now we will determine the final dataset for the carrier's position
  if (orientation == 'horizontal') {
    sub_positions <- data.frame(
      column = change_pos,
      row = static_pos,
      combination = paste(LETTERS[static_pos],change_pos,sep = "")
    )}
  else {
    sub_positions <- data.frame(
      column = static_pos,
      row = change_pos,
      combination = paste(LETTERS[change_pos],static_pos,sep = "")
    )}
  
  return(sub_positions %>%
           mutate(ship = "submarine")
  )
  
}
submarine <- sub_fun()

#valid positioning sub
while(any(do.call(paste,submarine[,1:2]) %in% do.call(paste,battleship_red))) {
  submarine <- sub_fun(sample(1:1000))
}

#sub redzone
sub_red <- red_zone(submarine) %>% 
  rbind(battleship_red)

#cruiser has same size as sub (3), so we just use the sub function again
cruiser <- sub_fun() %>%
  mutate(ship = "cruiser")

#valid positioning cruiser
while(any(do.call(paste,cruiser[,1:2]) %in% do.call(paste,sub_red))) {
  cruiser <- sub_fun(sample(1:1000)) %>%
    mutate(ship = "cruiser")
}

#cruiser redzone
cruiser_red <- red_zone(cruiser) %>%
  rbind(sub_red)

###DESTROYER FUNCTION
des_fun <- function(x = sample(1:1000)) {
  seed <- sample(x)
  set.seed(seed)
  #orientation determines the direction of a ship's placement
  orientation <- unlist(sample(c('horizontal','vertical'),1))
  
  
  #change_pos will be a vector of 5 numbers designating a ship's position along one axis
  #if orientation is horizontal, change_pos = columns
  #if orientation is vertical, change_pos = rows
  start_change <- unlist(sample(seq.int(1,10),1))
  change_pos <- c(seq.int(start_change,start_change + 1))
  
  
  #we will also ensure that no part of the ship goes off the board
  #if a number in change_pos is over 10, we subtract 5 from that element
  for (i in seq(1,2))  {if (change_pos[i]>10) {
    change_pos[i] <- change_pos[i] - 2
  }}
  
  
  #static_pos will be a single number denoting a ship's position along the other axis
  static_pos <- unlist(sample(seq.int(1,10),1))
  
  
  #now we will determine the final dataset for the carrier's position
  if (orientation == 'horizontal') {
    des_positions <- data.frame(
      column = change_pos,
      row = static_pos,
      combination = paste(LETTERS[static_pos],change_pos,sep = "")
    )}
  else {
    des_positions <- data.frame(
      column = static_pos,
      row = change_pos,
      combination = paste(LETTERS[change_pos],static_pos,sep = "")
    )}
  
  return(des_positions %>%
           mutate(ship = "destroyer")
  )
}

destroyer <- des_fun()

#valid positioning destroyer
while(any(do.call(paste,destroyer[,1:2]) %in% do.call(paste,cruiser_red))) {
  destroyer <- des_fun(sample(1:1000))
}

#final ship position df
ships <- rbind(carrier,battleship,submarine,cruiser,destroyer)
ships
```

Now we have valid positions for each ship: Carrier, Battleship, Submarine, Cruiser, and Destroyer. The above dataframe will be stored as "ships" for further use. Let's continue by placing these ships on the board we created earlier using a for loop:

```{r ship_placement}
final_board <- board
for (i in 1:17) {
  final_board[ships$row[i],ships$column[i]] <- ifelse(
    ships$ship[i] == "cruiser",
    "R",
    ships$ship[i] %>% 
      substr(1,1) %>% toupper()
  )
}

final_board
```

Now that we have the ships placed, we can set up the game. The turn variable will be a counter that escalates one unit each time the computer makes a guess. To make the visualization easier, we will create a single, final, dataframe that includes the game board at different periods of time. The plan will be to animate the final game using turn as a state.

```{r game_setup}
turn <- 0
final_df <- expand.grid(
  row = LETTERS[1:10],
  column = 1:10
) %>%
  mutate(
    obs = final_board %>% unlist(),
    turn = turn
  )
```

Now we will create the guess mechanic and win condition. Each guess will 

```{r game_progression}
single_guess <- function(final_board) {
  
  #pos creates the row and column guesses from a random sample
  pos <- sample(1:10,2,replace = TRUE)
  
  #The while statement will ensure the guess is unique compared to previous guesses made
  while (grepl("O|X",final_board[pos[1],pos[2]])) {
    pos <- sample(1:10,2,replace = TRUE)
  } 
  
  #This ifelse statement will determine a hit or miss
  final_board[pos[1],pos[2]] <- ifelse(
    grepl("C|B|S|R|D",final_board[pos[1],pos[2]]),
    "X",
    "O"
  )
  return(final_board)
}

#Now for the win condition, waiting for when no ships have any positions unguessed
while (any(grepl("C|B|S|R|D",final_board))) {
  final_board <- single_guess(final_board)
  turn <- turn + 1
  turn_df <- expand.grid(
    row = LETTERS[1:10],
    column = 1:10
  ) %>%
    mutate(
      obs = final_board %>% unlist(),
      turn = turn
    )
  final_df <- rbind(final_df,turn_df)
}
```

Now we have created a final_df with information regarding a complete game of Battleship. For example, we can tell the number of turns it took for the computer to win by the turn variable. In this case, it took the computer `r turn`'s to guess all the ships. Bear in mind this is a crude guessing method which randomly selects from any square not yet guessed. 

Now, we can create the final animation depicting the game:

```{r single_game_animation}
final_animation <- final_df %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_text(mapping = aes(
    x = column,
    y = row,
    label = obs
  )) +
  geom_tile(data = ships,
    aes(
      x = column,
      y = ifelse(row>5,5-(row-6),5+(6-row)), 
      fill = toupper(ship)
      ),
    alpha = .5
    ) + 
  scale_y_discrete(limits = LETTERS[10:1]) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = 1:10,position = "top") +
  ggtitle(
    label = 'Turn {closest_state}',
    subtitle = paste('Win on turn: ',turn, sep = "")
    ) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust =.5),
    axis.title = element_blank()
    )  +
  labs(fill = "SHIP") +
  transition_states(turn)

animate(final_animation,nframes = 200,fps = 5)
```

Since the rmd format ensures the same game over and over for a single animation, let's create one more game animation:

```{r game_2,echo=FALSE}
#recreate initial board
board <- data.frame(matrix("~", nrow = 10, ncol = 10))
colnames(board) <- seq.int(1,10)
rownames(board) <- LETTERS[seq.int(1,10)]

carrier <- carrier_fun()
carrier_red <- red_zone(carrier)

battleship <- battleship_fun()

  battleship <- battleship_fun(sample(1:1000))
}
battleship_red <- red_zone(battleship) %>% 
  rbind(carrier_red)

submarine <- sub_fun()
while(any(do.call(paste,submarine[,1:2]) %in% do.call(paste,battleship_red))) {
  submarine <- sub_fun(sample(1:1000))
}
sub_red <- red_zone(submarine) %>% 
  rbind(battleship_red)

cruiser <- sub_fun() %>%
  mutate(ship = "cruiser")
while(any(do.call(paste,cruiser[,1:2]) %in% do.call(paste,sub_red))) {
  cruiser <- sub_fun(sample(1:1000)) %>%
    mutate(ship = "cruiser")
}
cruiser_red <- red_zone(cruiser) %>%
  rbind(sub_red)

destroyer <- des_fun()
while(any(do.call(paste,destroyer[,1:2]) %in% do.call(paste,cruiser_red))) {
  destroyer <- des_fun(sample(1:1000))
}

#ship position df
ships <- rbind(carrier,battleship,submarine,cruiser,destroyer)

#create the board with ships on it
final_board <- board
for (i in 1:17) {
  final_board[ships$row[i],ships$column[i]] <- ifelse(
    ships$ship[i] == "cruiser",
    "R",
    ships$ship[i] %>% 
      substr(1,1) %>% toupper()
  )
}

#set turn counter
turn <- 0
final_df <- expand.grid(
  row = LETTERS[1:10],
  column = 1:10
) %>%
  mutate(
    obs = final_board %>% unlist(),
    turn = turn
  )

#while loop to create a board for all guesses until win condition
while (any(grepl("C|B|S|R|D",final_board))) {
  final_board <- single_guess(final_board)
  turn <- turn + 1
  turn_df <- expand.grid(
    row = LETTERS[1:10],
    column = 1:10
  ) %>%
    mutate(
      obs = final_board %>% unlist(),
      turn = turn
    )
  final_df <- rbind(final_df,turn_df)
}

final_animation <- final_df %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_text(mapping = aes(
    x = column,
    y = row,
    label = obs
  )) +
  geom_tile(
    data = ships,
    aes(
      x = column,
      y = ifelse(row>5,5-(row-6),5+(6-row)),

```
